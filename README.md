# Domain_Analysis
An assignment on Domain analysis for 2025 CSC 211 UMary
This will lead to the final assignment (although counted as a homework assignment)
**Goal:** to provide a domain analysis for the inventory issues at UMary.
**Requirement:** each person needs to provide their own work. Use the book to give further explanations and examples
1) Categorize problems
   -provide a clear categorized list of topics this project will cover
   -this should be generalized - to help determine what will be domain specific and independent, as independent will be our framework
2) Research Similiar problems
     - Do research on other inventory problems. cite websites and providea detailed explaination of how 3 other companies/industries handle inventory. 1 page total.
3) Domain Description
     - create a glossary of words that will be useful so far we have:
       In_house_item: currently have and store item in specific location(s)​
        Custom_item: item we do not store, but needs to be approved for order.​
        Student_order: order request from student in a class that goes to Rodrigo for approval. <connected to custom_item>​
        Free_range_use_item: items that are freely used in classes. May be added and subtracted by students. ​
        Free_range_use_customer: allowing students to take and put back items in classes (ie 215) where you don't need to keep them. ​
        Tags: item description that will allow students to see related items​
        Catalog: master list of all items stored or ordered that Rodrigo can see and use and students can add/substract/ request. ​
        Inventory_changes: allow changes to instore items.

After the first pass, which will include pieces from class, you should edit or make new items.
    -defining characteristics of the domain
    -from characteristics, make specifications
    
4)Analyze generic facets of the domain.
  - connect the independent specifications that can be used as a framework
  - create connections between items from 3
5) Repeatedly review and refine
  - after finishing what was done in class, I'd like you to go through the cycle 2 times. Mark any ideas that were decided during these processes

**Deliverable**
For the submission, you need to create documentation for all the above. this can be done via a mixture of images, pdfs, flowcharts, etc. 
Use README.md to provide a directory for all information from this assignment (ie Analysis of generic facets of the domain is a PDF with connections drawn in the "Facets" directory)
